# Oh Raspberries

created by Myriam Aviles, Tianna Calderon, and Makenzie Dorsey

---
Since 2019, we have been participating in hackathons as
a four person "Dream Team" determined make a project using 
platforms and technologies unfamiliar to us. Unfortunately,
one of our friend was unable to join us so we decided 
to dedicate our project to her.

### Inspiration

We were inspired by our friend's favorite fruit, raspberries,
and the mysteries contained in working with APIs. We have 
never worked with APIs before tnd upon further research about 
the plethora of APIs available to the public, we happened upon 
the Spoonacular API and decided to take on the challenge.

### What is Oh Raspberries

Oh Raspberries is a website that provides the user with a recipe
based on their choice of vitamins they want to boost, their favorite 
fruit, or if they would like to try something new. Our responsive 
website is perfect for any device which would allow the user to find 
recipies at home or on the go.

### What languages and platforms were utilized

We programmed our website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Due to
previous collaboration issues we have faced before, we took advantage
of [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) because we are able to upload 
assets, create new project files, and edit code togehter in real time. 
Additionally, it allows us to export our code straight into our Github 
respository from our project space.

### Challenges we faced

Some of the challenges we faced include registering a domain through AWS,
working with APIs for the first time, and re-learning how to 
build a website. 

After we solidified our website idea, we needed to register with a service
to get our own personal domain name. Going through AWS services and trying to
obtain the specific information we were looking for took hours. By the time
we went through out primary, alterante, and cotingency plan for web hosting, 
our domain name finally worked.

APIs are something we have never worked with before. Though we have all been
exposed to their remarkable abilities, getting the API to fetch and display
information is easier said than done. After the workshop and subsequent youtube
tutorials, a breakthrough was reached.

Despite us all having experience with programming, we have not made a website
since 2017 as a school project. While we had basic knowledge of HTML tags and
CSS styling, we had to learn more about formatting, javascript functions, and
personalizing the webpage to our tastes.

### Accomplishments we are proud of

We are extermely proud to have implemented the Spoonacular API into
our project despite the challenges faced involving getting information
from the API and learning how to display it within our project. Though 
we did deviate from our original design plan, we are all over the moon
with our project and were able to achieve more than we originally imagined.


### What we learned

We have learned that 
> "teamwork makes the dream work" - Myriam

and to always have alternate plans in case things do not go as planned. 
It was not possible to avoid every single obstacle that came our way and
we learned to work around them in creative ways. We have also learned that
it is easier to delegate tasks rather than have everyone working on different
aspects of the project at a time.

### Future directions for Oh Raspberries

In the future we would like to implement a map API that would allow the user
to locate grocery stores and markets in their area that have the ingredients
they need for their meal. It would also be helpful to let the user know if their
particular ingredients are in season. Lastly, we would hopefully like to make a
similar website based on vegetables called Oh Broccoli.
