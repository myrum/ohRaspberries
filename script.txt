tips from sponsorship lead
    one way would be to briefly go over how a user
    would interact and use your project and then
    perhaps segue into the technocal details on
    how you built those features
    
    there is a recorded part of the presentation
    and then the live demo. try to record the parts
    you will have trouble explaining live that way you
    will be more comfortable speaking about it live
